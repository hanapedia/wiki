# Software Engineering Background
## 2019: Hello World, Hello Programming
I encoutered programming in 2019 when I took programming course in college.
Since then, I was entrigued by the cources in Inforamtion Science and continued to learn the basics of topics such as OS, Networking, Machine Learning/Deep Learning, Algorithm & Data Structure.

<br>
<br>

## 2021: Jumping into the world of Web
Although I was enjoying academic programming used in college courses, I had always wondered where programming is used in the actual world. That was the starting point of my jouney in the web.

<br>

### August 2021, My First Major Project: [GlobeChat][]
First, I started from Frontend and Backend development using Laravel and Vue.
I developed a group chatting application called GlobeChat, which has 3D UI that visualize the engagement from the users in the chat room. 
I also presented this application in a student pitch contest in Japan called Giikuten. 
You can see the application in action in the [giikuten-slides][] that I used. 

The whole application was developed and deployed in the spand of *2 months*.
##### **Tech Stack**
Frontend: Vue, Three.js

Backend: Laravel

<br>

### December 2021, My First Team Development: MShare
As a team of four, we have developed Video Sharing Web Application that provides a unique rating system. User's facial expressions when watching the video are tallied directly to the rating of the video.
I worked on the integration of the facial expression detector on to the frontend and also the deployment of the backend to AWS services.

The original application was developed in a week for a Hackason and was later refined.
##### **Tech Stack**
[Frontend][MShare-frontend]: Next.js, React

[Backend][MShare-backend]: Next.js, AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda

<br>
<br>

## 2022: Diving Deeper
As I continued my jouney in the web development, I became more and more interested in lower layers of the web.
At the same time, I was wondering how bigger applications are developed and ran in the real world.
That was when I started look into concepts such as Kubernetes and Microservices.

### April 2022 ~ February 2023, Senior Thesis

#### Bare-metal Kubernetes Cluster

#### Microservices Topology Configuration tool (prototype)

<br>
<br>

## 2023: Starting My Career as Software Engineer

### February 2023, Viviane

### August 2023, Cybozu

### October 2023, DMM.com


## 2023: Starting My Master's

### Hexagon

### Multi-node Bare-metal Kubernetes cluster operation
